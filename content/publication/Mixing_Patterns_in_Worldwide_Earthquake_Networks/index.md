abstract: 'In this work, we have studied the assortativity of worldwide earthquake networks. We have used data from the worldwide earthquake catalog for the period between 2002 and 2016 of earthquakes with magnitude $m\geq4.5$. The study was conducted for two different networks: the first one using data of shallow earthquakes (depth up to 70km) and the second constructed for deep events (depth greater than 70km), both for the world. We calculated the average nearest neighborsâ€™ degree of nodes (ANND) distribution and the degree correlation coefficient (DCC) for both networks. It was observed that the network of shallow events is assortative. The same result was found in previous studies for networks of earthquakes from California and Japan, and also for networks of earthquakes produced by computer simulations. The network of deep earthquakes was found to be neutral. Our results contribute to the understanding of the seismological dynamics and features.'
